	* sha1.test: Fixed broken error messages for 8.4. Using
	  [tcltest::getErrorMessage] now to get the correct message for
	  all versions of the core. Bug [440051] reported by Larry Virden.

	* New module, 'sha1'. The code is Don Libes's <libes@nist.gov>
	  sha1pure, with Donal K. Fellows's patches to speed it up, and
	  extended with a soft dependency on Trf to allow higher speed if
	  the environment is right.
