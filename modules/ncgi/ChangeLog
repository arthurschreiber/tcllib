	* ncgi.tcl: Changed ncgi::parseMimeValue such that a key-value
	pair like name="" would turn into the list {name {}} instead of
	{name {""}}.

	* ncgi.tcl: Changed ncgi::list to ncgi::nvlist (for "name value list") becauase
	of the inevitable conflict with the global list command.

	Added ncgi::cookie and ncgi::setcookie

	* ncgi.test: Fixed tests that created files with "source ncgi.tcl"
	in them to use full path for sourcing, so that tests could be run
	from any directory. [Bug: 4393]

2000-03-15  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* ncgi.tcl: added ncgi::reset so the ncgi package can be used inside
	TclHttpd

	* ncgi.test: added ncgi::reset tests, renumbered everything, and
	switch most tests to use ncgi::reset

2000-03-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Added package index file.

	* ncgi.test: Added code to add source dir to auto_path, so that 
	tests could be run on uninstalled package.  Added call to 
	tcltest::cleanupTests.
