	* ncgi.tcl: fixed bug 5727 where Netscape prepends an extra \n to
	post data sent via HTTPS.  Urlencoded post does not include
	preceding or trailing whitespace, so to be safe, we trim
	whitespace off the post data before parsing the attributes.

	* ncgi.tcl:  Changed ncgi::redirect so it grabs the server name
	from REQUEST_URI before using the SERVER_NAME value.  This is so
	the server name matches the previous page better.  Otherwise a
	transition from "www" to "www.scriptics.com" can trigger
	Basic Authentication challenges.

	* ncgi/ncgi.tcl:
	Moved the '+' decoding from nvlist down into ncgi::decode.
	Changed ncgi::value to strip out the structure associated with
	multipart/form-data values.  Use ncgi::valueList to get the
	structured value.

	* ncgi.tcl: Changed ncgi::parseMimeValue such that a key-value
	pair like name="" would turn into the list {name {}} instead of
	{name {""}}.

	* ncgi.tcl, ncgi.test: changed names to get capitalization
	right: setCookie, valueList, importAll, urlStub

2000-04-17  Brent Welch  <welch@scriptics.com>

	* ncgi.tcl: Fixed ncgi::reset with no query data.  Fixed
	ncgi::multipart because it usually gets \r\n data.

2000-04-14  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>
	
	* ncgi.tcl: Changed ncgi::list to ncgi::nvlist (for "name value
	list") becauase	of the inevitable conflict with the global list
	command.  Added ncgi::importall to import a set of cgi variables.
	Added multipart/form-data parsing.  Added ncgi::cookie and
	ncgi::setcookie.

2000-03-20  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* ncgi.test: Fixed tests that created files with "source ncgi.tcl"
	in them to use full path for sourcing, so that tests could be run
	from any directory. [Bug: 4393]

2000-03-15  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* ncgi.tcl: added ncgi::reset so the ncgi package can be used inside
	TclHttpd

	* ncgi.test: added ncgi::reset tests, renumbered everything, and
	switch most tests to use ncgi::reset

2000-03-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Added package index file.

	* ncgi.test: Added code to add source dir to auto_path, so that 
	tests could be run on uninstalled package.  Added call to 
	tcltest::cleanupTests.
