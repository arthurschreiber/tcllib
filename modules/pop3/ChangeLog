	* pop3.tcl: Based on feedback from Cameron Laird, I did some
	digging into the RFC and figured out that using the number of
	octets given by RETR at the beginning of the retrieval to grab
	that number of bytes was far more efficient.  Thanks to Cameron
	for pointing that out.  Speed for retrieval should be greatly
	improved.  Changed version to 1.1.

	* pop3.tcl:
	* pop3.n:  Applied patch from Petteri Kettunen to add the LIST and
	TOP implementations.  See RFC1939.  Also removed a spurious puts
	command.  [bug: 5426]

2000-05-17  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* pop3.tcl:  Remove extra '.'s added by the POP3 server.  If a
	line begins with a '.', the server will add a '.' to the line to
	prevent confusion with the end-of-message character (which is also
	'.'). [bug: 5522]

	* ChangeLog:
	* man.macros:
	* pkgIndex.tcl:
	* pop3.n:
	* pop3.tcl:  New POP3 email client API, inspired by Scott
	Beasley's "frenchie" email client program.
