	* pop3.tcl:
	* pop3.n:  Applied patch from Petteri Kettunen to add the LIST and
	TOP implementations.  See RFC1939.  Also removed a spurious puts
	command.  [bug: 5426]

2000-05-17  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* pop3.tcl:  Remove extra '.'s added by the POP3 server.  If a
	line begins with a '.', the server will add a '.' to the line to
	prevent confusion with the end-of-message character (which is also
	'.'). [bug: 5522]
