	* base64.test: Adapted tests to work in tcllib test framework.

	* base64.test: Added tests for decoding data that was padded with ='s

	* base64.tcl: Fixed a bug with line wrapping in the encoder -- it
	was not properly counting the number of characters emitted, so it 
	was not wrapping when it should.  Changed the chars/line to 60, so 
	the output would be identical to that produced by GNU uuecode 4.2,
	for easy testing purposes.  Fixed a bug in the decoder with
	newlines -- it was not ignoring them as it should according to RFC
	2045.
	Fixed a bug in decoder dealing with data that was padded with ='s.
	

	* base64.test: Some rudimentary tests for the encoder/decoder.

	* pkgIndex.tcl: added pkgIndex file.
