	* cmdline.tcl: Changed cmdline::getopt to set boolean arguments to
	0 or 1 explicitly.  Previously it just set the value to "" if it

	line bug in connect.

	* typedCmdline.test: Changed sourcing bits at start of file to
	work better with updated file dependancies.

	* typedCmdline.tcl: Removed "package provide"; that should occur
	only in one file per package.  Reformatted function headers to
	comply with Tcl coding standard.  Renamed "cmdline::lsearch" to
	"cmdline::prefixSearch" to avoid confusion, and removed code thus
	made obsolete.
