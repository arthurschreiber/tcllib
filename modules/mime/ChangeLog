	* mime/smtp.tcl: Fixed bug 5693, where the "To:" header wasn't
	being sent with an e-mail when using the -recipients flag of
	smtp::sendmessage.  Also, if -recipients was combined with -header
	"To ..." or -header "Cc ...", it would send the message only to
	-recipients (which is documented) but it would leave the Cc and To
	headers, which are wrong.  This is also fixed.

	* mime/mime.tcl
	* mime/mime.test: Fixed bugs 5521 and 5659, where qp_encode and
	qp_decode had numerous bugs.  See #5659 for details.

	* mime/smtp.tcl: Fixed a bug where if the requested mail server
	didn't exist (i.e. the host didn't have an SMTP server running),
	smtp::sendmessage would continue executing until a horrific crash
	at a later point.  I added the check and proper error reporting.

	* mime/smtp.tcl: Fixed bug 5383, where smtp wouldn't work because
	it had a dependency on Trf.  I've patched the code, and it seems
	to work fine now.

	* modules/mime/mime.test: Added a somewhat rudimentary test suite
	for TclMIME.  Found what I believe is a minor bug in the package,
	but decided not to fix it (and just let the relevant test fail)
	until I can discuss it with Brent.

	* modules/mime/mime.tcl: Modified this to have a soft dependency on
	the Trf package.  If it is available then the encoding and decoding
	of MIME base64 and quoted-printable will run faster.
	Also added mime::buildmessage that creates the structured MIME message
	in a string and returns that - much like mime::copymessage that
	copies the message to a channel.
