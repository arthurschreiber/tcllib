	* md5.test: Added tests of "md5::hmac". This allows us to test the
	  two different implementations against each other.

	  Note: The test file will now print which of the two variants
	  (pure Tcl vs. Trf based) is active and under test.

	* md5.tcl: Added code to create a soft dependency on Trf. In other
	  words, if Trf is present it will be loaded and used to speed up
	  operations. Without Trf the original code in pure Tcl will be
	  used. Note that the presence of Trf allows us to optimize the
	  command "md5::hmac" too.

	* New module, 'md5'. The code Don Libes's <libes@nist.gov>
	  md5pure, extended with a soft dependency on Trf to allow higher
	  speed if the environment is right.
