2000-04-28  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* mkInstallScripts.tcl: Fixed a bug in the UNIX shell script where
	it was checking if TCLINSTALL was non-null, but it was using ==,
	which isn't legal in /bin/sh.  I found this out the hard way while
	trying to install tcllib0.4 in the default location
	(/usr/local/lib/tcllib0.4) and because of this bug, it ended up
	installing in /lib/tcllib0.4.
	
2000-04-26  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped patchlevel to 0.4
	* Makefile.in: Fixed dist target to deal with missing manual

	the unix install.sh script

2000-03-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mkIndex.tcl: Added missing "== -1" to [lsearch] for package dir
	in generated pkgIndex.tcl.

2000-03-28  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added $(srcdir)/ prefix to mkIndex.tcl call in the
	install-libraries target, so that it would find the mkIndex.tcl
	script when run outside of the source tree.  Same for man.macros
	in the install-doc target, so it would find the file.

2000-03-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added dist target for building distribution.

	* configure.in: Removed mkIndex.tcl from AC_OUTPUT call.

	simple INSTALL.BAT and install.sh files for tcllib distributions.

	* mkIndex.tcl: 
	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Replace mkIndex.tcl.in with mkIndex.tcl, which
	now takes more args to specify values.

2000-03-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added ncgi module, commented out until tests are done.

2000-03-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* all.tcl: First checkin of all.tcl, the magic that hides behind
	"make test".

2000-03-08  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Commented out cgi module until it's ready for use.
	Added checks for bogus module names in install-libraries, but
	they're not foolproof.

2000-03-07  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* modules/cgi: Preliminary version of a CGI module.  Still needs
	some cookie functions, test suite, and docs...
	
2000-03-07  Eric Melski <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* modules/math: math library

	* Makefile.in: added math library to list of modules

2000-03-07  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* configure.in: 
	* configure: 
	* aclocal.m4:
	* Makefile.in: Changed to use shared config subdirectory.  Also
	fixed problem on Windows builds where it would fail to identify
	the tclsh executable to use.  Simplified configure.in to minimum
	number of macros.

2000-03-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* man.macros: Moved from individual modules to toplevel tcllib
	dir, so that it is not repeated hundreds of times.
	
	* Makefile.in:
	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Added version number to installed tcllib dir.

	* license.terms: Adapted license from Tcl.
	
	* README: Added more information about file layout in module dirs.

	* Makefile.in:  added pop3 module.

2000-03-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Instead of probing install dir for modules,
	changed to take module list on command line, so that users can
	change what goes into the pkgIndex.tcl from the Makefile.
	
	* Makefile.in: additional work on module list and pkgIndex.tcl
	generation.  Now changing the module list changes what is
	installed and what is put in the pkgIndex.tcl.

2000-03-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Work on install-libraries, install-doc; removed
	references to compiled bits.

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Tweaked the generated pkgIndex.tcl to only
	append the dirname if it doesn't already exist in the auto_path,
	and to use \[file dirname \[info script\]\] instead of [pwd].

	* configure:
	* configure.in: Removed checks for compiler, and all stuff related
	to compiling/linking (this is a tcl only extension).

	* tcl.m4: new tcl.m4 from sample extension.

	supporting files
