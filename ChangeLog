	* Makefile.in: Commented out cgi module until it's ready for use.
	Added checks for bogus module names in install-libraries, but
	they're not foolproof.

2000-03-07  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* modules/mime/mime.tcl: Modified this to have a soft dependency on
	the Trf package.  If it is available then the encoding and decoding
	of MIME base64 and quoted-printable will run faster.
	Also added mime::buildmessage that creates the structured MIME message
	in a string and returns that - much like mime::copymessage that
	copies the message to a channel.

	* modules/cgi/cgi.tcl: Preliminary version of a CGI module.  Still
	needs some cookie functions, test suite, and docs...

2000-03-07  Eric Melski <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* modules/math: math library

	* Makefile.in: added math library to list of modules

2000-03-07  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* configure.in: 
	* configure: 
	* aclocal.m4:
	* Makefile.in: Changed to use shared config subdirectory.  Also
	fixed problem on Windows builds where it would fail to identify
	the tclsh executable to use.  Simplified configure.in to minimum
	number of macros.

2000-03-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* man.macros: Moved from individual modules to toplevel tcllib
	dir, so that it is not repeated hundreds of times.
	
	* Makefile.in:
	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Added version number to installed tcllib dir.

	* license.terms: Adapted license from Tcl.
	
	* README: Added more information about file layout in module dirs.

2000-03-06  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in:  added pop3 module.

2000-03-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Instead of probing install dir for modules,
	changed to take module list on command line, so that users can
	change what goes into the pkgIndex.tcl from the Makefile.
	
	* Makefile.in: additional work on module list and pkgIndex.tcl
	generation.  Now changing the module list changes what is
	installed and what is put in the pkgIndex.tcl.

2000-03-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Work on install-libraries, install-doc; removed
	references to compiled bits.

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Tweaked the generated pkgIndex.tcl to only
	append the dirname if it doesn't already exist in the auto_path,
	and to use \[file dirname \[info script\]\] instead of [pwd].

	* configure:
	* configure.in: Removed checks for compiler, and all stuff related
	to compiling/linking (this is a tcl only extension).

	* tcl.m4: new tcl.m4 from sample extension.

2000-03-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added fileutil, cmdline, mime, base64 modules.

2000-02-24  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in, et al: Preliminary Makefile and configure script, and
	supporting files
