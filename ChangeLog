    * Makefile.in: Work on install-libraries, install-doc; removed
    references to compiled bits.

    * mkIndex.tcl.in: Tweaked the generated pkgIndex.tcl to only
    append the dirname if it doesn't already exist in the auto_path,
    and to use \[file dirname \[info script\]\] instead of [pwd].

    * configure:
    * configure.in: Removed checks for compiler, and all stuff related
    to compiling/linking (this is a tcl only extension).

    * tcl.m4: new tcl.m4 from sample extension.
